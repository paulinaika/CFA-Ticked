# About the Project
A study conducted by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) estimated that tick-borne diseases cost the cattle industry approximately $146m in production losses and control costs. As ticks developed a quick resistant to vaccines, it is important for researchers to get real time data to speed up the research process to understand the distribution in order to study the origin and prevent the spread of tick-borne diseases.

In order to impress Bill and Melinda Gates, I have chosen a topic that has not received enough coverage. I decided to work in this project as a few researchers that I have known faced the issue of not being able to collect real-time data on the spread distribution of cattle ticks. Sometimes, these cattle ticks are brought in due to importation and exportation of cattle breeds. Possibly, with the help of cattle breeders, we will be able to map out the distribution of cattle ticks within Australia and all over the globe.


# The Thinking Process
I have brainstormed the idea and possible problems of this project through [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/WDWOgyNk/cfa-major-project). I then proceeded to identify the core functions of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and also to identify the possible future functions to be added to my application.

# Design Decisions
Since my main users would be researchers and cattle breeders, I wanted an app that look clean and professional rather than something that is looking very fancy. One of the main reasons is that most of the cattle breeders are living in rural areas where there are limited connection. Therefore, I has developed the app to be mobile friendly first rather than for web design functionality so that it can be easily accessible even with limited connection.
